This is one of the projects that I work on in my free time from work. I really love the Miami Dolphins and wanted to make something to showcase that it is a work in progress and the basic layout was reused from another project I worked on during my time in bootcamp. I hope to one day have it up and running so my friends and I and all of you could hang out there and enjoy the best Miami Dolphins highlights.
